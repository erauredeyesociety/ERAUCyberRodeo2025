Some best practices to follow:
1. This challenge was designed to improve static analysis. If you do decide to run or debug this malware because you are curious, run this in a VM.
2. If you run this in a VM, do a snapshot beforehand because it can and will brick your VM
3. If you accidentally encrypt all your files, a hardcoded AES key is inside the binary. You will need to reverse the malware to find the key.
3a. decrypt_your_files.exe will help you recover your files
4. If you accidentally run the binary on a computer with important files, let the encryption program run all the way to completion.
4a. The decryption program will completely undo the encryption, but not if you terminate it half-way

By unziping the sample, you agree to not be stupid with this malware and follow best practices. Additionally, we are not responsible for any damages you might cause.
