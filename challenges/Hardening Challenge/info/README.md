## Description

We have noticed a variety of unauthorized activity on one of our servers, but we haven't been able to figure out the root causes. Please login to the server, investigate these vulnerabilites, and fix the issues. You may have to hunt around on the system somewhat as we do not know the exact problems that exist. As you make progress hardening the server, check the updates.txt file in the home directory for your challenge flags, but please note that some challenges may take a minute to update. There is no specific order that these vulnerabilities need to be fixed in.
