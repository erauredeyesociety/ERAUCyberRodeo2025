Welcome to Embedded Systems! Pick up a PCB and a USB cable to start.

```An employee at the Terminus airport was doing a routine sweep of the terminals when they stumbled upon an unknown device. Our security team quickly retrieved it and placed it under quarantine for further investigation. You have been tasked with exploring the device to recover key information regarding its purpose and reporting it to your superiors.```

Embedded Systems are a category of computers that are specifically programmed for typically one purpose. These devices are extremely popular and can be found everywhere: aircraft, vending machines, industrial control systems, spacecraft, smart watches, etc. Being a very common device, it is imperative for these systems to be secure and use standard cybersecurity practices.

This module is setup to teach basic properties of micrcontrollers and how to interact with them. The final challenges within this module will present a common vulnerability in embedded systems! 

Use the following equipment to solve these challenges:
Digital Oscilloscope Explorer (Analog Discovery 2: Digital Oscilloscope)
Provided breadboard w/ ESP32
Serial => USB converter
Serial monitor provided on laptop (puTTY)  *Only a limited amount available
