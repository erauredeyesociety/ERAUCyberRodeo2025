Having sifted through the expansive collection of open GitHub files, you and the Aurora Alliance's intelligence team have identified several potentially crucial pieces of information.

Firstly, the passphrase for a WIFI network. Secondly, the ground-to-satellite link for the Space Laser is unencrypted and lacks any form of authentication. Additionally, the use of outdated and insecure protocols like TELNET and FTP. Most intriguingly, in the "meeting minutes" memo, the overworked and underappreciated IT staff pinpointed an IP address that seems accessible from the public internet.

Why not devise some NMAP scans to thoroughly investigate this IP address, which appears to be a part of the Nebula Syndicates Development/Test network?
