## Description

Blue Bird believes its booking website is and/or has been a possible target for attacks. The team believes attackers may either be attempting to alter flights using unauthorized admin access or attempting to view confidential client information using the itinerary view functionality. The booking site is available for guest users to search for bookable flights, registered users to book flights and view their personal itineraries, and the Blue Bird booking manager to use admin access to manage users, change flights, and transfer tickets between registered users. The site displays information similar to other booking sites like the time of the flight, price, emissions, and layovers. The task is to gain administrative access by finding vulnerabilities and discovering methods of possible previous attacks.
