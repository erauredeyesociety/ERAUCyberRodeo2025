# [MITRE] Firmware Extraction and Decoding

## Description

After interrogating the Mastermind, we find out that the swarm is set to happen soon. They also tell us the drone we captured is the lead drone. Whatever this drone does all other drones will follow. We must find a way to stop the image from appearing!

This challenge can be started independently of the previous challenges, and is a precursor to “\[MITRE] Firmware Extraction and Decoding” and “\[MITRE] Firmware Extraction and Decoding


**Objective:** Decode the file on the SD card to reveal the hidden image.
