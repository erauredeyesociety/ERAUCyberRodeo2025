# [MITRE] Info

## Description

You find out that someone has hacked a drone swarm that NFL coordinators were intending to use during the half time show at the Superbowl this weekend. Instead of displaying cool drone stuff, the hacker programmed the drone swarm to display a big giant frowny face that would definitely
make everybody sad. What’s worse – they also have more drone swarms across the country in a few major cities to make even more people super sad. Your job is to stop this impending crisis of the nationwide frowny-face.
