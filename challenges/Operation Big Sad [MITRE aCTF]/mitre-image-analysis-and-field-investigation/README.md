# [MITRE] Image Analysis and Field Investigation

## Description

**PART 1!**

As you worked on reverse engineering the drone, our investigation team has captured the Mastermind! The Mastermind posted a photo online giving away the location by accident. The investigation team was able to gain access to the Mastermindâ€™s phone. Upon searching through the phone, the team discovered this photo taken only a few hours before. They need your help finding where it was taken. The investigation team thinks this is where the Mastermind has been keeping his secret documents.

**Objective:** Analyze an image to find the next flag.

**Instructions:** You will be provided with an image. Your task is to use the image to locate the secret wiring diagram used for interacting with the drones. The wiring diagram will give you the final clue you are looking for to stop this attack once and for all.


**PART 2!**

**Objective:** Trigger a firmware readout by jumping specific pins, capture the data, and decode it to reveal the secret image.

**Instructions:** Using the wiring diagram and pin information, jump the correct pin(s) on terminal block #1 to load the data onto the SD card.

**Note:** Pins on Terminal Block #2 are **NOT** used for this challenge.
