## Description

Bluebird Jet Air flight 4 has recently gone missing somewhere in the Pacific ocean.  The airliner's wreckage has not yet been found and its black boxes (flight data recorders) are assumed to have been destroyed in the crash.  The only evidence for the crash of BBJA flight 4 is a data bus diagnostic device that was found washed up on a popular beach in Hawaii.Several such bus monitors were installed on the aircraft a few weeks before the flight as part of a new data-driven maintenance optimization initiative being tested by Bluebird Jet Air.  While in flight, the bus monitors would capture a few minutes ARINC 429 data bus traffic at a time and store it locally. Once the aircraft would land, the data would be transmitted back to Bluebird Jet Air HQ via a cellular connection.

The device that washed up on shore was identified by serial number to be the bus monitor that was attached to the data bus segment coming from one of the aircraft's Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRU).

Can you decode the ARINC 429 capture and find out what happened to BBJA flight 4?
