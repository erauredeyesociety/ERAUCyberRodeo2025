## Description

You just got a new radio scanner.  You are near a major airport and have tuned your radio to AM 131.550 MHz.  After listening for a few seconds, you hear the following sounds.  (See downloadable wav files.)  You do some research and learn that 131.550 MHz is in the range of frequencies allocated for the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS).The following video gives some more info about what ACARS is and how it works: https://youtu.be/jxZnmsF2xgQ?t=41
You will be provided with a linux environment containing a compiled version of ACARSDEC, an open source acars decoder. https://github.com/TLeconte/acarsdecThe ACARSDEC executable is located in the ~/acarsdec folder.

Your challenge is to use ACARSDEC to decode the the ACARS messages recorded in the audio files located in ~/examples.  The questions for this challenge will be based on the messages in ex1.wav.

The following desktop has a tool you can use to decode:

`ssh desktop@chals.aviationcyberctf.com`

`password: desktop`
