# [ERAU DB] Info

## Description

This challenge will be aimed at landing at KDAB with the Diamond DA-62. When flying the mission, you or a delegate from your team can fly the mission, or you may decide to sacrifice total points for a staff member to assist in operating the aircraft.

**How challenges are conducted**

• Each of the contestants will be given 20 minutes for an attempt. Time starts when the contestant steps up to the station. 
		
• A team member will roll dice to determine the scenario.  
		
• If done correctly, the landing attempt should take approximately 10 minutes. A missed approach may be conducted, if needed, but the timer is still ticking. If a missed approach is done, the proper published missed approach procedure must be used.
		
**How points are awarded**

• There are two categories of points, the flight category and the anomaly category. Each of these will provide a maximum of 50 points for a grand total of 100 points.

 • Each attempt will always include a flight portion, and participants can also answer questions for the anomaly portion at any time during their attempt.
		
• Participants earn points by completing a scenario. At the end of each scenario, they must choose to either store or take their points:
		
   ◦ Take the Points: The points are immediately added to their final score, but they cannot attempt another scenario.
				
   ◦ Store the Points: They can try the scenario again to potentially earn a higher score, but the stored points are not added to their final score unless chosen as their highest-scoring attempt by the end of the day. 
				
At the end of the day, only the points from a team’s highest-scoring scenario are added to their final score.

**Flight Category (50 points total):**

**1.**  30 points ... for landing on your cleared runway.
		
**2.** 10 points ... for keeping on the runway until the aircraft comes to a complete stop.
		
**3.** 10 points ... for the quality of your approach before minimums.
		
**Events that result in failure of the scenario**

Performing the following will result in 0 points awarded (for all categories):

1. Crashing. In addition to obvious failures such as flight into terrain or structural failure, performing maneuvers in an overtly unsafe manner will also be treated as a crash.
		
2. Not landing on the cleared runway.
		
3. Landing using the wrong procedure (e.g. ILS approach instead of an RNAV/RNP approach).

**Staff Assistance**

**1.** \[Autopilot Staff] (0/50 points earnable for the flight category)

a. Using staff to fly the aircraft will result in 0 points awarded in the flight category.
				
**2.** \[Assist Staff] (25/50 points earnable for the flight category)

a. Using staff to assist the team in flying aircraft will result in half credit in the flight category.
				
**3.** \[Zero Staff] (50/50 points earnable for the flight category)

a. Staff will not assist the team whatsoever in the flight of the aircraft.


**Staff flight assistance (Autopilot Staff):**

You may choose to have a staff member completely fly the aircraft. If you decide to do so, the staff will strictly fly by the instruments. You will still need to provide instructions to the piloting staff member to ensure the flight successfully and safely lands on the cleared runway. Again, choosing this option will result in no points awarded in the flight category. You may still get points in the anomaly section.

**Staff flight assistance (Assistance Staff):**

You may also request assistance in flying the aircraft, where the staff member will provide hints and general flight guidance while your team's designated pilot flies the aircraft. Choosing this route will result in a 50% reduction in any points gained in the flight category.


**There are no CTFd challenges after this info card, all points will be awarded manually as determined by the challenge judges.**
