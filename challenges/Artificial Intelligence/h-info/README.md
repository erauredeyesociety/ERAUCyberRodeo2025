## Description

Bluebird Jet Air proudly announced a new, state-of-the-art AI system: Bluebird Sentinel

It is designed to detect anomalous engine cycles in an aircraft and help keep the skies safe! Unfortunately, as we attempted to deploy the system, the hacktivists corrupted the files... and we don't have backups... Could you help us rebuild Bluebird Sentinel?
