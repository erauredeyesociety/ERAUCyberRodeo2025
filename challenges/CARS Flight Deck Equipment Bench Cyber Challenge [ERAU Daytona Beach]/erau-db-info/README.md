## Description

The two test benches will be set up for the event for the attendees to tackle. The first will be the Cessna Citation XLS, which will provide a general overview for the attendees to get familiarized with avionics in general and be a bit of a learning experience if they have never seen these systems before. The second challenge will be on the King Air 200.
